Week one: topic Selection and Outline
The goal of this weak is to chose the 3  concepts that will be converted into a series of infographics and make there detailed outline.
The 3 concepts: 
1.	Explainability and Transparency in AI
•	Key Points: Why is it important for AI systems to be explainable and transparent? What challenges arise when AI systems are not easily understandable?
•	Visual Elements: Flowcharts showing how explainable AI works, comparison images between transparent and opaque AI systems.
2.	Bias and Fairness in AI
•	Key Points: Discuss the impact of bias in AI algorithms, the importance of fairness, and how bias can be mitigated.
•	Visual Elements: Pie charts or graphs illustrating biased outcomes, images representing fairness in AI decision-making.
3.	AI Ethics and Responsible AI
•	Key Points: Explore the ethical considerations in AI development, the role of responsible AI practices, and the potential consequences of unethical AI.
•	Visual Elements: Icons representing ethical principles, a roadmap for responsible AI development.
