The goal of this week is to continue generating the images necessary to the infographics
and the textes that are necessary to aware the targeted audience.

Introduction:
    Prompt :
        The robot stands at the entrance of an "AI Awareness Center" with a sign saying "Bias and Fairness in AI - Introduction."
    Text :
        Bias in AI refers to the presence of systematic and unfair preferences or prejudices in the design, implementation, or use of artificial intelligence algorithms. 
        This bias can lead to discriminatory outcomes that disproportionately affect certain groups, perpetuating societal inequalities.
        Let,s follow our guide though the his journey to explore Bias and Fairness in AI.

Impact of Bias in AI:
Prompt :
    The robot watches examples of bias on a screen: biased hiring and facial recognition. 
    Its expression changes, realizing the consequences of biased decisions.
Text :
    Fairness in AI algorithms is crucial to ensure equitable treatment and opportunities for all individuals, irrespective of their demographic characteristics. 
    Without fairness, AI systems may reinforce existing biases, exacerbate social disparities, and compromise ethical standards.
    Biaised algorithm for hiring recomendation can have sever consequence on a society for exemple.

Causes of Bias in AI:
Prompt :
    The robot is in a virtual world, standing in front of a corrupted "Data Collection" and "Biased Algorithmic ."
    We can see the corruption clearly because the data collection is gigantic and messy, it is crawling on the robot.
Text :
    Some AI can even be considered disfonctioning because of Bias. It is because of one of these two reasons :
    Data Collection Issues; Historical biases, underrepresentation, and sampling bias contribute to skewed datasets.
    Algorithmic Biases; Model design choices, training processes can introduce biases.

Mitigating Bias in AI:
Prompt :
    The robot sits at a table with diverse AI experts, discussing fairness metrics and strategies for reducing bias. 
    Charts on the wall illustrate these approaches.
Text :
    But Bias can be mitigated or avoided via using metrics such as :
    demographic parity, equalized odds, and disparate impact analysis.
Image 6 - Conclusion:
Prompt :
    The robot, now equipped with knowledge.  
    The final image captures the robot functioning correctly in a fair and unbiased environment.
Text : 
    Efforts to address bias in AI development are not only ethical imperatives but also crucial for building trust and ensuring responsible and equitable AI deployment. 
    Collaboration among developers, policymakers, and the wider community is essential for navigating the complexities of bias in AI responsibly.
