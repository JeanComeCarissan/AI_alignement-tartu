The goal of this weak is to start the infographics according to the plan and the subject dictated the last week.
My first idea is to generate a prompt to create a background for infographic using an image creation ai then modifieit using canvas to add a text.

Explainability and Transparency in AI

Introduction :
    prompt : 
        Design an abstract background that represents the concept of 'Explainable AI.' 
        Use geometric shapes and soft colors to convey a sense of clarity and understanding
    text :

How Explainable AI works:
    prompt : 
        Generate a visually striking circuit board or neural network background symbolizing Explainable AI. Focus on interconnected components:
        Data Input: Use a distinctive entry point for raw data.
        Pre-processing: Visualize data preparation with unique graphics.
        Model Training: Illustrate the AI model's training phase dynamically.
        Explainability Integration: Highlight this stage with eye-catching elements.
        Decision-Making Node: Emphasize a visually significant point of decision.
        Output: Depict the final output creatively.
        Utilize a cool color palette, emphasizing blues and silvers, to evoke a sense of technological sophistication. Ensure the overall design is graphically engaging without relying on text."

Conclusion :
    prompt :
            Generate a visually impactful conclusion that signifies transparency and progress in AI:
            Transparency Symbol: Integrate a clear or glass-like element to symbolize transparency within the AI system.
            Pathway of Understanding: Create a visual pathway weaving through gears or interconnected nodes, emphasizing the journey towards transparency.
            Incorporate Light Elements: Introduce subtle highlights or light beams to represent the 'unveiling' of information.
            Unified Color Palette: Use a unified color palette, blending cool tones to maintain a technological and sophisticated atmosphere.
            Ensure the design reflects a sense of clarity, openness, and progression. Let the visuals tell the story of transparency within the AI process

        Unveiling the Future: Summary and Action Steps for Transparent AI

These prompt were too vague and didn't gave a satisfying result (folder image_week_2_1). 
The problem is that can't understand such a complicated topic to generate image. 
But goimg with prompt that are not precise enough leads to underwealmimg result.
My second attempt was to create infographics that were more story oriented. 
Were the AI is personalized by a robot. To make it simpler.

Explainability and Transparency in AI

Introduction :
Prompt for Scene :
Set the scene in a futuristic lab where a scientist unveils a new AI robot to a curious audience. 
The robot stands tall, its design sleek and modern. 
In the background, a holographic display highlights the words 'Explainable AI' and 'Transparency.
Text : 
Introducing Explainable AI, a concept ensuring that artificial intelligence systems are understandable and transparent. 
Explore the importance of transparency in fostering trust and accountability.


Why Explainability Matters :
Prompt :
Transition to a bustling city where the AI robot interacts with a human in a public space. 
The robot helps the human with a task,helping humans to build something, showcasing transparency in its decision-making process.
Text :
Why Explainability matters in AI? 
Because transparency not only builds trust and user acceptance but also holds the technology accountable for its decision-making processes,
ensuring responsible and ethical AI applications.

Challenges in Achieving Explainability :
Prompt :
Shift to the AI lab, revealing the complexity of the AI model. Illustrate the scientist and the AI navigating through a maze of intricate neural pathways and decision nodes. 
The challenge is apparent as they balance the need for explainability with optimal performance.
Text :
Ballance is the main challenge in achieving Explainability, as AI models become increasingly complex.
Scientists need to navigate the delicate balance between making AI systems understandable while maintaining optimal performance.

How Explainable AI Works :
Prompt :
Zoom in on a detailed flowchart hovering in the lab, showcasing the explainable AI process. 
The AI robot stands beside it, pointing out key steps. On the other side, a contrasting flowchart illustrates the opaque process of a non-explainable model. 
Visualize the clarity and transparency of the explainable model.
Text :
At times, AI may be unexplainable due to the complexity of deep learning models and the intricate patterns they learn.
As models become more sophisticated, 
interpreting the exact logic behind certain decisions can be challenging, resulting in less explainable outcomes.
Explainable AI achieves transparency by providing clear insights into its decision-making process. 
It employs interpretable algorithms and models, 
allowing humans to understand and trust the rationale behind AI decisions.

Chapter 5: Conclusion :
Prompt :
Conclude in a serene setting, perhaps a virtual library or a tranquil garden. 
The AI robot and the human engage in conversation, summarizing the key points of the interaction. 
Display a holographic screen with the words 'Summary' and 'Call to Action,' signifying a thoughtful reflection on the importance of transparent AI.
Text : Explainability and transparency in AI are vital for fostering trust and accountability. 
They ensure that users, developers, and stakeholders can understand, verify, and influence the decisions made by artificial intelligence systems, 
promoting responsible and ethical AI practices.

Althought I am not fully satisfied with the result I think the story method does a better job explaining why Explainability and Transparency in AI matters.
I will keep going on this diresction for next week.
